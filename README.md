# Grouper
iPhone app that allows one to make groups out of lists of people.

Feature List:
	- Create lists of people (teams, classes, etc)
	- Edit those lists after creation
	- Choose one or more of those lists of people and create a specified number of groups from them
		- i.e.: from a list of students, create even groups for a project
	- Store those created groups in the app
	- Send any created groups through email (PDF?)
	- Create restrictions (pairs of people who can’t be in a group together)
		- Have validation that makes sure it isn’t impossible
